# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Damilola! I have a degree in Biochemistry and I'm currently on track to completing a diploma in Data Analysis. I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Excel and have data analytics techniques such as data mining, report writing and statistics.
In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with data and a keen eye in identifying patterns and trends. I also included work in the programming language: Phyton
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analysis related topics.
I welcome any oppurtunity to discuss my qualifications further with you. Thank you for your time.
